build a mini compiler for FROG using C 


info given from uni paper: 

#########################################################################################################
goal of this project is to build a compiler thats able to analyse (lexical, syntax, symantic)
a FROG file 


for testing the file going to be a .FRG written with FROG

for lexical analysis:
- all the tokens has to be known

for lexical syntaxic: 
-syntaxic errors should be shown like false declarations...etc

for semantic analaysis:
-symantic errors should be shown like the unmatched types, using variables that arent declared...etc

frog code should be written like this:
-begins with FRG_Begin
-ends with FRG_End
-one instruction per line
-instruction ends with #
-a comment takes the whole line and starts with #
-ID always starts with a character and then can be followed by numbers
-integers composed by one number minimium and should be declared with FRG_Int followed by its ID
-float composed by two integers split by '.' and declared with FRG_Real followed by its ID
-string placed between two double quotes and declared with FRG_Strg followed by its ID

all this should be presented with an interface with a button that give user access to upload his .frg file
with three buttons 
analyse lexicale
analyse syntaxic
analyse semantique

under it two blocks one containing the source code of the frg file and the other file will be the result
of the click of buttons

tokens: 
-basically everything in code to feed to the parser

symbol: 
-keeps tracks of whats written in code


example FRG_Int x:=3 x:

tokens:
FRG_Int type integer
x ID
:= assign
3 number

symbol: 
x type: integer ,value: 3
